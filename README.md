# Atropos

This codebase is a moderation tool for Discord, which aims to be a one-stop-shop for essential and highly useful features, without any unnecessary bloat.

It can be run so long as an appropriately-setup database is available and configured. Take care in doing so! At the time of writing, Atropos is incomplete and highly unstable.

I will be adding a link to the documentation to this README (and actually making a proper README) as soon as I feel it is ready to be properly opened up. At the moment, it is on and off in a sort of beta for testing and further development.

Eventually, I will also attempt to make this more easily user-hostable. This will include a premade database schema and various other potential tools for rapidity and ease of use.
